# Csv Files

A Comma Separated Values (CSV) file is a plain text file that contains a list of data. These files are often used for exchanging data between different applications. For example, databases and contact managers often support CSV files.

These files may sometimes be called Character Separated Values or Comma Delimited files. They mostly use the comma character to separate (or delimit) data, but sometimes use other characters, like semicolons. The idea is that you can export complex data from one application to a CSV file, and then import the data in that CSV file into another application.

The imported data could be used in several ways such as producing visualizations, descriptive statistics, predictive modeling, or simply for cleaning and preprocessing.

The csv file in our project should look like this:
