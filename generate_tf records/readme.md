# Tensorflow Records

If you are working with large datasets, using a binary file format for storage of your data can have a significant impact on the performance of your import pipeline and as a consequence on the training time of your model. Binary data takes up less space on disk, takes less time to copy and can be read much more efficiently from disk. This is especially true if your data is stored on spinning disks, due to the much lower read/write performance in comparison with SSDs.


However, pure performance isn’t the only advantage of the TFRecord file format. It is optimized for use with Tensorflow in multiple ways. To start with, it makes it easy to combine multiple datasets and integrates seamlessly with the data import and preprocessing functionality provided by the library. Especially for datasets that are too large to be stored fully in memory this is an advantage as only the data that is required at the time (e.g. a batch) is loaded from disk and then processed. Another major advantage of TFRecords is that it is possible to store sequence data — for instance, a time series or word encodings — in a way that allows for very efficient and (from a coding perspective) convenient import of this type of data.
